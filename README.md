This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## But before NetJS configuration settings:
Hi, and welcome to Poke-UI, the newest Pokedex experience!

- This project was originally thought to be done with CRA (Create-react-app) but due to software problems (new release, Ubuntu incompatibilities) I was finally done with NextJS, which is a ReactJS Framework.

### Steps to configure the project
It's quite easy
1- Clone or dowload this Repo
2- At Repo folder, open a CLI and run "npm i" or "npm install", which will trigger the installation of all the packages needed to run this tiny microfrontend.
3- After installation is done, in the same CLI run "npm run dev", which is a script already added and configured by NextJS on the package.json.
4- That's it!

Start finding/searching your favorite Pokemons!

p.D: Advice: *Check your spelling! If pokemon doesn't exist, PokeUI cant find it :P...or can it?*

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
